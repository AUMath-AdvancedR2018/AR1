This is an introduction in how to use the AR1 package. The package contains a few functions that can fx simulate a AR(1) process. (...)

### Installing
A quick guide on how to install the package.


### Examples of how to use the simulation function
We will here show an example, that should visualize how to use the function. Here we have a AR(1) process where the white noise, $\varepsilon_n$, is a process with zero mean and variance 1 and the parameter, $\varphi$, is 0.8. Futhermore we have that $Y_0=0$. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
```

```{r}
<<simulation>>
```
