\usage{
LLN(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of random variables.}
}
\value{
A plot through the values \degn{sum_{i=1}^{k}y_j/k} for each k from 1 to n, in addition to a line through the mean of y.
}
\description{
A function that checks, if there is a Law of Large Numbers
}
\details{
If a given output of this function resembles that it converges towards the line through the mean of y, it would seem that there is a Law of Large Numbers.
